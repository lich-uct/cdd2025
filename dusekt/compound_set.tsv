Buffer B (50 μL) was added to a 96-well microassay plate (Corning Incorporated). The membrane reference standard suspended in buffer B at 250 μg/mL was added by 50 μL. A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer). The GF/C filter plate was immersed in 0.3% polyethyleneimine for one day before use."

Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin.

Buffer B (50 μL) was added to a 96-well microassay plate (Corning Incorporated). The membrane reference standard suspended in buffer B at 250 μg/mL was added by 50 μL. A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

Buffer B (50 μL) was added to a 96-well microassay plate (Corning Incorporated). The membrane reference standard suspended in buffer B at 250 μg/mL was added by 50 μL. A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

The obtained pellets were washed with PBS (Phosphate-Buffered saline) (GIBCO), disrupted in buffer A (50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (Tris-HCl) (pH 7.4) containing 120 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM potassium chloride, 2 μg/mL chymostatin, 40 μg/mL bacitracin, 40 μg/mL APMSF (p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematika, Germany), and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 40 min. The precipitation fraction was suspended in buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/mL chymostatin, 40 μg/mL bacitracin, 40 μg/mL APMSF, 3 mM manganese dichloride (MnCl2)) and cryopreserved (−80° C.) as a receptor reference standard. Buffer B (50 μL) was added to a 96-well microassay plate (Corning Incorporated). The membrane reference standard suspended in buffer B at 250 μg/mL was added by 50 μL. A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer). The GF/C filter plate was immersed in 0.3% polyethyleneimine for one day before use."

Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

The obtained pellets were washed with PBS (Phosphate-Buffered saline) (GIBCO), disrupted in buffer A (50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (Tris-HCl) (pH 7.4) containing 120 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM potassium chloride, 2 μg/mL chymostatin, 40 μg/mL bacitracin, 40 μg/mL APMSF (p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematika, Germany), and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 40 min. The precipitation fraction was suspended in buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/mL chymostatin, 40 μg/mL bacitracin, 40 μg/mL APMSF, 3 mM manganese dichloride (MnCl2)) and cryopreserved (−80° C.) as a receptor reference standard. Buffer B (50 μL) was added to a 96-well microassay plate (Corning Incorporated). The membrane reference standard suspended in buffer B at 250 μg/mL was added by 50 μL. A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer). The GF/C filter plate was immersed in 0.3% polyethyleneimine for one day before use."

A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

A measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the total binding, 4 μM non-labeled SP diluted with a measurement buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide was added by 50 μL to examine the non-specific binding, and a test compound diluted with a measurement buffer (containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added by 50 μL to examine the binding inhibitory activity of the test compound. Furthermore, 400 μM 125I-Bolton-Hunter-SP (BH-SP) solution was added to each well by 50 μL. After reaction at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was quenched using a cell harvester (PerkinElmer) by rapid filtration on a GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer), and the cells were washed 10 times with 250 μL of a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The GF/C filter plate was dried, MicroScinti-0 (PerkinElmer) was added by 20 μL, and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount (PerkinElmer).
